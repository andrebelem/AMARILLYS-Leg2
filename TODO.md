Tasks TODO in the repository:

- Reanalyze CTD data in two separate sets (SBE and Casq).
- Align conductivity and oxygen sensors of SBE 911plus.
- Filter and clean fluorescence data, comparing it with RBR XR-620 Casq (intercalibration from zero-layer).
- Add SUD (Surface Underway Data) with SBE TSG + Weather to GitHub.
- Include satellite images (MODIS bio-optics and Sentinel SSS).
- Develop more maps using pygmt and create additional scripts.

Major review planned for end of July 2023
